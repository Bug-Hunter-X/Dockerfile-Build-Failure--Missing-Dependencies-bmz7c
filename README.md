This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to include a requirements.txt file when your application relies on external Python packages. The initial Dockerfile attempts to run a Python script that imports `requests`, but the build process fails because `requests` is not installed.  The fixed Dockerfile includes the necessary steps to install dependencies using `pip`.
